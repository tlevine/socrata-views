This dataset defines individuals filing a resident tax form as full-year residents. Resident tax returns that have New York State addresses but indicate no county of residence are categorized as “NYS Unclassified.”  Resident returns can also have out-of-state addresses. Returns in this category occur because the department accepts resident returns from part-year residents who have moved to another state during the year. Resident returns can also come from individuals who use the out-of-state addresses of their tax preparers, or use the addresses of their permanent homes or domiciles in other states while they maintain living quarters and are present in the state for more than half a year. Resident tax returns that have out-of-state addresses but show no New York county of residence, are still classified as resident returns, but they are put in the “Residence Unknown” category.

The employment figure is an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (regardless of the place of residence of the workers) rather than a count of jobs held by the residents of the area. Industries are classified according to their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Monthly job estimates for areas below the state level are not adjusted for seasonal changes in employment. It is important to keep in mind that month-to-month changes may be due to regular seasonal patterns in an industry. Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical. Data adjusted for seasonal changes are only available for industry divisions at the state level. Monthly fluctuations in the wage and salary employment data are an essential part of the changes that occur in a dynamic economy of the county or region. It is important to study the data over time to evaluate the strength of the local economy. Wage and salary employment data identify which industries have the largest number of jobs. An industry with a large number of workers may not necessarily be expanding; it may even be downsizing. New and expanding industries may not have large numbers of existing jobs but are a good source for new job opportunities. Annual average data over time tend to be a better indicator of employment trends for the various industries in an area. ",

It does not include the self-employed, unpaid family workers, and private household employees. Jobs located in the area that pay wages and salaries are counted although workers may live outside the area. Jobs are counted regardless of the number of hours worked. Individuals who hold more than one job (i.e. multiple job holders) may be counted more than once. The employment figure is an estimate of the number of jobs in the area (regardless of the place of residence of the workers) rather than a count of jobs held by the residents of the area. Industries are classified according to their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. Monthly job estimates for areas below the state level are not adjusted for seasonal changes in employment. It is important to keep in mind that month-to-month changes may be due to regular seasonal patterns in an industry. Typically, during the winter holiday shopping season retail jobs increase, and during the summer there are more workers in the construction industry. On the other hand, changes may reflect new businesses, expansions, closings, etc. Comparison of monthly changes for the same period in prior years will provide a better understanding of whether the change is seasonal or atypical. Data adjusted for seasonal changes are only available for industry divisions at the state level. Monthly fluctuations in the wage and salary employment data are an essential part of the changes that occur in a dynamic economy of the county or region. It is important to study the data over time to evaluate the strength of the local economy. Wage and salary employment data identify which industries have the largest number of jobs. An industry with a large number of workers may not necessarily be expanding; it may even be downsizing. New and expanding industries may not have large numbers of existing jobs but are a good source for new job opportunities. Annual average data over time tend to be a better indicator of employment trends for the various industries in an area. ",

DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.",

  "description" : "The Department of Taxation and Finance administers the statewide New York State general retail sales and compensating use tax, as well as any general retail sales and compensating use tax imposed by a county or municipality in New York State. In addition, the Department administers any taxes imposed on consumer utilities services and other special taxes on selected commodities and services by municipalities and city school districts. This data set presents information on the amount of the distribution of these taxes back to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the ten most recent state fiscal years ended March 31. The state’s sales tax is distributed to the state during the same month of collection. Generally, all local sales taxes collected are distributed back to the appropriate taxing jurisdiction in the month subsequent to collection. A large majority of the distributions reflect collections from taxable sales reported and remitted during the preceding month. However, the net distributions also include adjustments for prior taxable sales periods resulting from resolving returns processing exception issues, and are also affected by timing of remittances by sales tax vendors as determined by their annual amount of taxable sales. Local taxing jurisdictions’ fiscal years are not identical to the state fiscal year. Distribution information in this data set is presented by state fiscal year to be consistent with other state tax collection information presented in the Annual Statistical Report of New York State Tax Collections. The sales tax distribution information in this data set can be found in this publication.",

This dataset defines individuals filing a resident tax as full-year residents. Resident tax returns that have New York State addresses but indicate no county of residence are categorized as “NYS Unclassified.”  Resident returns can also have out-of-state addresses. Returns in this category occur because the department accepts resident returns from part-year residents who have moved to another state during the year. Resident returns can also come from individuals who use the out-of-state addresses of their tax preparers, or use the addresses of their permanent homes or domiciles in other states while they maintain living quarters and are present in the state for more than half a year. Resident tax returns that have out-of-state addresses but show no New York county of residence, are still classified as resident returns, but they are put in the “Residence Unknown” category.

  "description" : "The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.",

While most points represent a single accessible site, a few represent a destination grouping of nearby and related accessible facilities. Based on staff inspections, sites without any features meeting proposed ADAAG for Outdoor Areas or that do not provide meaningful access to recreation were omitted. All attributes were manually entered, based on staff inspections. Sites were inspected by DEC staff, trained in the ADAAG Proposed Guidelines for Outdoor Recreation Areas (United States Access Board, 2007)."

Over the years, we've consolidated or eliminated departments, cut personnel, refinanced debt, reduced departmental expenditures, extended the life of our landfill, successfully lobbied for increase State aid and identified new sources of revenue.  These actions are the blocks upon which this budget is built, as they continue to have a recurring benefit to our bottom line.  It is important to note that, in fact, 84% of this budget, exclusive of debt services, is related to personnel costs.  The remainder is related to essential operating services, such as utility expenses; building maintenance; insurance costs and the like.",

  "description" : "The Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) collects crime reports from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs’ departments. DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State, law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI, based on US Census information. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.",

Second, methods for attributing emissions to biogenic energy recourses have not reached consensus.  Most biofuels are treated as carbon neutral, despite growing awareness that these fuel categories should have emissions allocated to them.  Third, greenhouse influencing emissions are converted to a \"carbon equivalent\" through the use of the EPA's Greenhouse Warming Potential rates.  These are estimates that change over time as the science is refined."

  "description" : "The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program (also known as ES-202) collects employment and wage data from employers covered by New York State's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Law. This program is a cooperative program with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. QCEW data encompass approximately 97 percent of New York's nonfarm employment, providing a virtual census of employees and their wages as well as the most complete universe of employment and wage data, by industry, at the State, regional and county levels. \"Covered\" employment refers broadly to both private-sector employees as well as state, county, and municipal government employees insured under the New York State Unemployment Insurance (UI) Act. Federal employees are insured under separate laws, but are considered covered for the purposes of the program. Employee categories not covered by UI include some agricultural workers, railroad workers, private household workers, student workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family workers. QCEW data are similar to monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) data in that they reflect jobs by place of work; therefore, if a person holds two jobs, he or she is counted twice. However, since the QCEW program, by definition, only measures employment covered by unemployment insurance laws, its totals will not be the same as CES employment totals due to the employee categories excluded by UI.",

Occupational projections are based on staffing patterns derived from the OES survey and past and current industrial and occupational trends. They serve to illustrate likely employment patterns, barring major changes from past trends. However, the projection models do not take into account such factors as immigration, emergence of new occupations, relocation of employment opportunities, and major events such as war or an economic downturn that would significantly alter the industrial structure of the economy, the occupational staffing patterns, or the long-term rate of growth "

  "description" : "The Department of Taxation and Finance annually prepares a mandated report of statistical information on New York State Earned Income Tax credit. Data in this dataset are from Table 3, 5 and 7 of the report. It includes the distribution of credit and average amount of credit by credit type and place of residence. A large proportion of EITC claims are paid out in the form of cash rebates to taxpayers. This is because credit claimants are typically low and moderate-income taxpayers who have little or no pre-credit tax liability. However, in a significant number of cases credit claims are used to offset pre-credit New York State tax liability. In the aggregate, approximately 85 percent of credit claimed is typically returned to taxpayers in the form of cash rebates.

  "description" : "64 county jails outside New York City submit daily counts of their populations through the Jails Daily Population Reporting system (JDPRS) to the State Commission of Correction.  The JDPRS is accessed through the eJusticeNY Integrated Justice Portal, a secure website for law enforcement.  Through a collaborative effort with the State Commission of Corrections (SCOC), DCJS developed an annual jail population report which shows each jail’s average daily census for each year.  Daily counts are averaged and then divided by the number of days reported for that year. Since the daily population can fluctuate, this method ensures that the census counts shown for the year represent the true average for that year.  The counts submitted through JDPRS are categorized by type of offender and include Sentenced, Civil, Federal, Technical Parole Violators, State Readies and Other Unsentenced.   These jail population reports provide local officials with information on historical trends within their jurisdictions and possible population trends impacting the jail census.\r\nNOTE:  All figures represent an average daily census.",

Patterns and Trends data does not include petroleum products used for non-energy purposes such as: propane used in the chemical industry, asphalt, road oil, lubricants, and petrochemical feedstocks.  Second, methods for attributing emissions to biogenic energy recourses have not reached consensus.  Most biofuels are treated as carbon neutral, despite growing awareness that these fuel categories should have emissions allocated to them.  Third, greenhouse influencing emissions are converted to a \"carbon equivalent\" through the use of the EPA's Greenhouse Warming Potential rates.  These are estimates that change over time as the science is refined."

Outdoor facilities are susceptible to storm damage, weathering and natural disturbance. While most points represent a single accessible site, a few represent a destination grouping of nearby and related accessible facilities. Based on staff inspections, sites without any features meeting proposed ADAAG for Outdoor Areas or that do not provide meaningful access to recreation were omitted. All attributes were manually entered, based on staff inspections. Sites were inspected by DEC staff, trained in the ADAAG Proposed Guidelines for Outdoor Recreation Areas (United States Access Board, 2007)."

Arts for Transit works closely with the architects and engineers at MTA NYC Transit, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, to determine the parameters and sites for the artwork that is to be incorporated into each station scheduled for renovation. Both well-established and emerging artists contribute to the growing collection of works created in the materials of the system -mosaic, ceramic, tile, bronze, steel and glass. Artists are chosen through a competitive process that uses selection panels comprised of visual arts professionals and community representatives which review and select artists.

It would be misleading to utilize the numeric value to gauge traffic safety without accounting for varying exposure to risks or conflicts.  An exposure element, such as the number of vehicles using the roadway over a given time and distance, generally is combined with number of crashes to obtain a crash rate.  Neither the exposure element nor the crash rate is provided in the dataset.  The number of crashes at one facility should not be measured against the number of crashes at another facility, nor should it be compared to other highways or non-Port Authority facilities.  Each facility varies in geometric and operational characteristics, therefore the roadway environment and operational conditions to drivers are different, which means there are different contributing factors that influence the number of crashes."

However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

While this may seem like an error, plan significance ratings are based on how much a plan's rate differs from the statewide average and the number of individuals included in the rate. Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population.

Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample).

  "description" : "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

The ATS assesses (a) adult tobacco-related behavior, attitudes, and beliefs; (b) tobacco purchasing and cessation attempt behavior; (c) health status and health-related problems; (d) attitudes toward and exposure to secondhand smoke; (e) perceptions of risk related to tobacco use; (f) exposure to tobacco advertising or anti-tobacco health communications; and (g) attitudes toward other smoking policies. Some key survey items have been included since inception (e.g., current smoking status); some questions may be included for a shorter period of time to assess a time-sensitive issue (e.g., support for tax increase), and other questions may be rotated in and out of the survey instrument as deemed necessary."

The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents.

Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

  "description" : "The point map shows the obesity rate by grade level for public school districts in New York State, exclusive of New York City, from the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR). The initial view of the map is broken up into large geographic areas and displays the number of public school districts in each area. To drill down to a smaller geographic area, click directly on the area of the map or click the plus sign to zoom in on the map. The small blue dots represent school district offices, not the location of specific schools. Clicking on a dot will bring up a fly-out for that district, with information about the obesity rate, grade level, county, region and school years. You can click “next” on the fly-out to view the rate for all three grade levels (elementary, middle/high and district total). Please note that if the obesity rate value is blank on a given flyout, it means that obesity data for this school district and grade level could not be reported to the NYSDOH due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). For more information on FERPA, please refer to the Student Weight Overview document by clicking on the \"About\" tab. The map can be filtered by grade level by changing the options under the Filter tab. Removing the school district filter is not recommended. The map is based on data collected through the SWSCR.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the district, county and regional-level estimates may vary. New York City school districts are exempt from the NYS Education Law 903 and 904 that established the SWSCR system.

Each partner’s address, phone number and in many cases e-mail contact are provided.The Prevention Agenda 2013-17 is New York State’s health improvement plan for 2013 through 2017. This plan involves a unique mix of organizations including local health departments, health care providers, health plans, community based organizations, advocacy groups, academia, employers as well as state agencies, schools, and businesses whose activities can influence the health of individuals and communities and address health disparities. This unprecedented collaboration is designed to demonstrate how communities across the state can work together to improve the health and quality of life for all New Yorkers. The purpose of the dataset is to provide the public, health providers and tentative DOH partners with some basic information about who in NYS is working on prevention agenda related items.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

  "description" : "This chart displays the percent of students who are obese at the district level for seven regions of New York State and Statewide (excluding New York City). The black dotted line indicates the 2017 Prevention Agenda Target for obesity among public school children in New York State (exclusive of New York City).  The Prevention Agenda is New York’s State Health Improvement Plan and serves as the blueprint for state and local community action to improve the health of New Yorkers and address health disparities in five priority areas: preventing chronic diseases; promoting a healthy and safe environment; promoting healthy women, infants and children; promoting mental health and preventing substance abuse; and preventing HIV, STDs, vaccine preventable diseases and healthcare associated infections.  An objective (Objective 1.0.1) within the Preventing Chronic Disease priority area is to reduce the percentage of public school children who are obese by 5%, from 17.6% (2010-12) to 16.7% by 2017, as measured through the Student Weight Status Category Reporting system.  \r\n\r\nRemoving the area type and grade level filters are not recommended. The chart is based on data collected through the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR).\r\n\r\n For more information check outhttp://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/statistics_and_impact/student_weight_status_data.htm, see the Instruction Guide on How to Create Visualizations https://health.data.ny.gov/api/assets/6F21A68C-B934-4B52-BEBE-5CA3DA2FDB88 or go to the \"About\" tab .",

        "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.       public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC.

Note that the results for the \"Fence Line at Waste Area\" location are elevated compared to other locations.  Elevated radiation levels are expected at this monitoring location due to its proximity to a High Level Radioactive Waste Storage Facility.  This is an on-site location. Access to this location is controlled by the site operator.  Based on historical data and changes in site activities, monitoring at several locations was discontinued in July 2012 and going forward.  Present locations monitored, in addition to the \"Fence Line at Waste Area,\" are \"Rock Spring Road\" and \"Springville-Erie County.\"  Monitoring for this location was done in 1995 only.

  "description" : "This map displays the location and performance data for all participating clinics.  The view defaults to a high-level map of the Eastern United States with the entire HIVQUAL data set represented by a large red dot over New York State.  Clicking repeatedly on this dot zooms the view into New York, and as the view narrows the single dot is replaced by multiple dots that represent smaller clusters of sites.  (Red dots represent aggregated samples of 1000 or more; orange dots represent 100 to 999 patients; and yellow dots represent up to 99 patients).\r\n\r\nEach of these dots may be clicked in turn, which zooms the view into that area.  Data are eventually displayed at the level of individual clinics, which are represented by small blue dots.  Clicking on any of these generates a \"flyout\" text box that contains the program's name, its facility type, and the name, score and performance quintile for the current indicator.  Clicking \"view details for this row\" will display the entire data point in a table view below the map, including the street address for the clinic.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to scroll through the performance for each indicator by clicking repeatedly on the \"Next\" link in the flyout, it will usually be more convenient to filter the map data to focus on a particular indicator.  This can be done by typing a portion of the indicator name in the \"Indicator Name contains\" text box to the right of the map and then checking the box just to the left of that field.  For example, filtering on \"domestic\" will limit the display to the \"Domestic violence screening\" indicator.  Additional filtering options are provided that allow for focusing on particular types of facilities (e.g., just community health centers) and/or sites that score above any desired threshold value.\r\n\r\nIn addition to common map navigation options including using the mouse to drag the view or dragging a sliding scale to zoom in or out, there is a button with an arrow and crossed lines that provides a \"navigate to here\" feature.  Entering a street address will refocus the map on that location, and the user can then zoom out to see clinics in that area.\"",

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.",

Because school district boundaries do not align with county boundaries, the county-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county-code by NYSED.  County assignment is not based on county of residence.  The county-level estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in that county because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data."

The contract laboratory provides the radon test results to the individual home owner and the DOH Radon Program. All testing data is entered into our database. From this database, we are able to create radon prevalence maps, design special outreach activities and campaigns, and track the location in the home where the detector was placed.  \r\n\r\nThe radon test results obtained from this database may not be reflective of all radon tests completed in New York State. There are approximately 30,000-40,000 radon tests completed each year in New York State that are not purchased through the NYSDOH Radon Program. These tests are completed by resident home owners, inspectors, schools, etc. across the state.  A map by town is currently not available, but users can view a map by county.  The county map is Radon Test Results By County: Beginning 1987 and can be accessed from the main catalog.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/radiological/radon/radon.htm or go to the \"About\" tab.",

  "description" : "This dataset contains the number of cases, number of in hospital/30 day deaths, observed, expected and risk- adjusted mortality rates for Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) by cardiologist. Physician information is presented for each physician who a) performed 200 or more procedures during the three year analysis and/or b) performed at least one PCI in each of the three years. The results for physicians not meeting the above criteria are grouped together and reported as “All others” in the hospital in which the procedures are performed. Regions represent where the hospitals are located.  The initial Health Data NY dataset includes patients discharged between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Analyses of risk-adjusted mortality rates and associated risk factors are provided for the three-year period from 2008 through 2010. Analyses of all cases and non-emergency cases (which represent the majority of procedures) are included. Subsequent year reports data will be appended to this dataset.

  "description" : "This dataset contains the number of cases, number of in hospital/30 day deaths, observed, expected and risk- adjusted mortality rates for cardiac surgery by surgeon. Physician information is presented for each physician who a) performed 200 or more procedures during the three year analysis and/or b) performed at least one cardiac surgery in each of the three years. The results for physicians not meeting the above criteria are grouped together and reported as “All others” in the hospital in which the procedures are performed.  The initial Health Data NY dataset includes patients discharged between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Analyses of risk-adjusted mortality rates and associated risk factors are provided for 2010 and for the three-year period from 2008 through 2010. Regions represent where the hospitals are located. Subsequent year reports data will be appended to this dataset.   For more information check out: http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/consumer_information/cardiac_surgery/ or go to the “About” tab.",

The foods provided through WIC are a good source of nutrients often missing from the diets of women and young children. WIC participants have longer, healthier pregnancies and fewer premature births.

  "description" : "The Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR) collects weight status category data (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese, based on BMI-for-age percentile).  The dataset includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high).   The rates of overweight and obesity reported are percentages based on counts of students in selected grades (Pre-K, K, 2, 4, 7, 10) reported to the NYSDOH. Because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  For more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/, see our Instruction Guide on How to Create Visualizations https://health.data.ny.gov/api/assets/6490BDA9-AE4D-406F-BA5A-703793526B9F or go to the \"About\" tab.\nThis data set is available at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Student-Weight-Status-Category-Reporting-Results-B/es3k-2aus",

        "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the district, county and regional-level estimates may vary. New York City school districts are exempt from the NYS Education Law 903 and 904 that established the SWSCR system. Therefore this dataset excludes public school districts from the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond).

Please note that the program’s scope and corresponding sample schedules have been modified over this time period to reflect operational changes and site closures. As a result, certain sites may not show data for all years. Please note that this program is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation). Missing data is due to a lag time in receiving the data, sample that was damaged in transit, laboratory processing error, weather conditions that prevented collection of sample and/or equipment failure. The dataset does not represent nor does it include data collected by other programs. The datasets are organized by sites and include only samples found at those sites. A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance."

The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents. The EWPH-DCH (East Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes) project was designed as an educational and environmental change program with DCH (Day Care Home) providers as the primary target audience and the children and their parents as the secondary target audiences.

Users can explore where the Department of Health funded coalitions are located and the service areas they cover.  A health coalition is defined as \"a group involving multiple sectors of the community; coming together to identify community needs and solve community problems.\"  The information is useful for program planning, as well as to develop targeted interventions.  Additionally, the general public is able to identify projects within or near their communities.  For more information please visit http://www.health.ny.gov/community/minority/, or go to the \"About\" tab.\n\nThis data set is available at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Health-Coalitions-A-Resource-for-Community-Collabo/w43m-6kfj",

Records contain 2010 College-bound seniors mean SAT scores. \r\n\r\nRecords with 5 or fewer students are suppressed (marked ‘s’). \r\n\r\nCollege-bound seniors are those students that complete the SAT Questionnaire when they register for the SAT and identify that they will graduate from high school in a specific year. For example, the 2010 college-bound seniors are those students that self-reported they would graduate in 2010. Students are not required to complete the SAT Questionnaire in order to register for the SAT. Students who do not indicate which year they will graduate from high school will not be included in any college-bound senior report.  \r\n\r\nStudents are linked to schools by identifying which school they attend when registering for a College Board exam. A student is only included in a school’s report if he/she self-reports being enrolled at that school. \r\n\r\nData collected and processed by the College Board.",

  "description" : "High resolution land cover data set for New York City.  This is the 3ft version of the high-resolution land cover dataset for New York City. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces.  The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at 3 square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were the 2010 LiDAR and the 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (city boundary, building footprints, water, parking lots, roads, railroads, railroad structures, ballfields) provided by New York City (all ancillary datasets except railroads); UVM Spatial Analysis Laboratory manually created railroad polygons from manual interpretation of 2008 4-band orthoimagery.  The tree canopy class was considered current as of 2010; the remaining land-cover classes were considered current as of 2008. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) techniques were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets.  OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. More than 35,000 corrections were made to the classification.  Overall accuracy was 96%. This dataset was developed as part of the Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for New York City.  As such, it represents a 'top down' mapping perspective in which tree canopy over hanging other features is assigned to the tree canopy class.  At the time of its creation this dataset represents the most detailed and accurate land cover dataset for the area. This project was funded by National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF), although it is not specifically endorsed by either agency.  The methods used were developed by the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Laboratory, in collaboration with the New York City Urban Field Station, with funding from the USDA Forest Service.",

  "description" : "New York City Results on the New York State Mathematics Tests, Grades 3 - 8\r\nNotes:\r\nAs of 2006, the New York State Education Department expanded the ELA and mathematics testing programs to Grades 3-8. Previously, state tests were administered in Grades 4 and 8 and citywide tests were administered in Grades 3, 5, 6, and 7.\r\nIn 2006, NYSED treated District 75 students as a distinct geographic district. For 2007-2011, District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. Spreadsheets for District and Borough do not include District 75 students in 2006.\r\nStarting in 2010, NYSED changed the scale score required to meet each of the proficiency levels, increasing the number of questions students needed to answer correctly to meet proficiency.\r\n\r\nRows are suppressed (noted with ‘s’) if the number of tested students was 5 or fewer. \r\nPrior to 2011, the mean scale scores for ‘All Grades’ were not calculated.",

  "description" : "Graduation Outcomes - 4 Year Outcome - Cohorts of 2001 through 2006 (Classes of 2005 through 2010) \r\n\r\n•The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005). The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. For the most recent cohort, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported. \r\n\r\n•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. August outcomes are only reported for the most recent cohort. \r\n\r\n•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. \r\n\r\n•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. \r\n\r\n•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.",

  "description" : "The New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) is a community-based health survey conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Data was collected from June through December 2004. NYC HANES measured key health indicators in a sample of 1,999 randomly selected NYC adult residents through a detailed health interview and brief physical exam.  NYC HANES is modeled after a similar national survey - the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  SAS datasets (along with codebooks, documentation and sample SAS programs to merge datasets and analyze the data) have been provided.  Correct analysis of NYC HANES data requires computer software able to adjust for the survey’s complex design, such as SAS-callable SUDAAN (sample code provided) or survey modules in SAS, STATA or SPSS.   ",

  "description" : "This file contains 3 sets of shapefiles representing possible Flood Hazard Zone Areas in the 2020's, 2050's, and 2080's, based upon a central range sea level rise scenario. The NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes. All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes. This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. 1.\tMethods and Caveat – The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a “bathtub” methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent. 2.\tError – Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique. 3.\tInterpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.",

  "description" : "Tree Canopy (TC) Assessment metrics for New York City.  This dataset consists of TC metrics summarized to several different sets of geographic base layers. The metrics presented in this table are based on 2010 high resolution land cover dataset.\r\n\r\nThe TC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the forest.  Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing TC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible TC). \r\n\r\nExisting TC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset.  Possible TC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist.  Possible TC in a GIS context is determined by overlaying high resolution land cover with cadastral and planimetric datasets to include building polygons and road polygons.  \r\n\r\nPossible TC is queried out from this overlay and consists of all land that was not existing canopy, not water, not a building, and not a road.  Possible TC is further divided into two subcategories:  Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation.  Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy.  Examples of such features are parking lots, driveways (through overhanging coverage) and playgrounds.  Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy.  Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields.  TC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees.  Rather, the TC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions.   \r\n\r\nTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in map units) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel.  For example, an Existing TC Area (TC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing TC Percentage (TC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing TC is 13,677 (in map units) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy.   This assessment was completed by the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory with funding from National Urban and Community Forestry Advisory Council (NUCFAC) and the National Science Fundation (NSF) and in cooperation with the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station.\r\n\r\nThe TC Assessment protocols were developed by the USDA Forest Service's Northern Research Station and the University of Vermont's Spatial Analysis Laboratory in collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.  TC assessments have been conducted for numerous communities throughout the U.S. where the results have been instrumental in helping to establishing TC goals.",

  "description" : "Every year, all parents, all teachers, and students in grades 6 - 12 take the NYC School Survey. The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. \r\n\r\nSurvey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependant on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nThe NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. \r\n\r\nNew York City parents, students, and teachers reached new all-time participation highs on the 2011 School Survey. 960,191 surveys were submitted.",

The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year). Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. For the most recent cohort, graduation rates as of both June and August (including summer graduates) are reported. \r\n¶¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. August outcomes are only reported for the most recent cohort. \r\n¶¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶¶•Schools are listed by their current DBN's.",

  "description" : "This file contains 3 sets of shapefiles representing possible Flood Hazard Zone Areas in the 2020's, 2050's, and 2080's, based upon a rapid ice melt scenario.\r\n\r\nThe NYC Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (NYC OLTPS) and the City of New York assume no responsibility for the accuracy of this data or its suitability for any purposes.  All users should independently verify the accuracy of the data for their purposes.  This data on 1-in-100 year flood zones for New York City with Projected Sea Level Rise was produced by the Institute for Sustainable Cities, City University of New York for an analysis of large geographic areas only. \r\n\r\n1.\tMethods and Caveat – The projected flood extents included in this data reflect a “bathtub” methodology whereby a flood elevation is extrapolated landward until it reaches the equivalent contour height on land. This approach does not account for cumulative effects of soils, vegetation, surface permeability, bathymetry, infrastructure and beach structures, friction, and other factors that affect the movement of floodwaters resulting in local variations in flooding extent.\r\n2.\tError – Numerous sources of potential error are present in the data. These include limitations of model input and scope (climate and FEMA floodplain models), error inherent in model output, errors in and coarseness of topography, the rounding of base flood elevations to the nearest foot, and in GIS technique.\r\n3.\tInterpretation - The floodplains delineated in this data do not represent precise flood boundaries but rather illustrate two distinct areas of interest: A) areas that do not currently flood but are expected to potentially do so in the future and B) areas that do not currently flood and are unlikely to do so in the timeline of this research.",

  "description" : "Graduation Outcomes - Class of 2010 - Math/ELA Aspirational Performance Measure (APM) \r\n¶•The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. \r\n¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. \r\n¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. \r\n¶•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals. \r\n¶•Schools that had previously obtained a waiver to use alternative assessments (rather than Regents examinations) were omitted from the Math/ELA APM calculations.",

  "description" : "2006/07 Progress Report results for all schools (data as of 1/14/09)\r\n\r\nPeer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)\r\n\r\n1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need\r\n\r\n2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need\r\n\r\n3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. \r\n\r\n4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.  The additional credit section rewards schools demonstrating exceptional achievement (11 credits or more earned per year) among overage/under-credit populations.",

The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. \r\n\r\nSurvey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type). Survey questions assess the community's opinions on academic expectations, communication, engagement, and safety and respect. School leaders can use survey results to better understand their own school's strengths and target areas for improvement. \r\n\r\nThe NYC School Survey helps school leaders understand what key members of the school community say about the learning environment at each school. The information captured by the survey is designed to support a dialogue among all members of the school community about how to make the school a better place to learn. New York City parents, teachers, and students reached new participation heights on the 2010 School Survey. 922,694 surveys were submitted.",
