  "description" : "Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs) are multilateral financing arrangements for which the World Bank provides Trustee services that include committing and transferring funds to project implementers (generally international organizations such as multilateral development banks or UN agencies).  In all cases the World Bank as Trustee is required to act in accordance with instructions of independent governing bodies. \r\n\r\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities, the World Bank as Trustee complies with all sanctions applicable to  World Bank transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovative financing and governance arrangements of FIFs enable funds to be raised from multiple sources, including from sovereign and private sources. FIF structures are customizable. For instance FIFs have been customized to receive contributions in the form of concessional loans in addition to traditional grant funds, and can provide funding to recipients using customized financial products.",

In fulfilling its responsibilities, the World Bank as Trustee complies with all sanctions applicable to World Bank transactions.\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides data on FIFs cash transfers at the transaction detail level. Funds are channeled in a coordinated manner to a range of recipients in the public and private sectors through a variety of arrangements. FIF trusteeship involves holding, investing and transferring funds as directed by the FIF governing body. Trusteeship does not involve overseeing or supervising the use of funds; this is the role of other agencies that receive the funding and who are responsible for project or program implementation. Transfers are generally made by the Trustee to external agencies (other MDBs, UN agencies, etc.) for the implementation of activities.",

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .

The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

  "description" : "Private sector development requires more than just finance. Experience shows the powerful role advisory services can play in unlocking investment and helping businesses expand and create jobs.\r\n \r\nTo help the private sector in emerging markets, IFC provides advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and governments. Our experience shows that companies need more than financial investment to thrive—they need a regulatory environment that enables entrepreneurship, and advice on business best practices. Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects. We also help investment clients improve corporate governance and become more sustainable.\r\n\r\n We offer advice through nearly 1,100 Advisory Services staff in 85 offices across 73 countries. Funding comes from donor partners, IFC, and client contributions. Learn more at http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/as_ext_content/what+we+do/advisory+services? .",

The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",
