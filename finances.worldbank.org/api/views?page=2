  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

  "description" : "Financial Intermediary Funds (FIFs) are multilateral financing arrangements for which the World Bank provides Trustee services that include committing and transferring funds to project implementers (generally international organizations such as multilateral development banks or UN agencies).  In all cases the World Bank as Trustee is required to act in accordance with instructions of independent governing bodies. \r\n\r\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities, the World Bank as Trustee complies with all sanctions applicable to  World Bank transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovative financing and governance arrangements of FIFs enable funds to be raised from multiple sources, including from sovereign and private sources. FIF structures are customizable. For instance FIFs have been customized to receive contributions in the form of concessional loans in addition to traditional grant funds, and can provide funding to recipients using customized financial products.",

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

  "description" : "The Category Schedule page allows World Bank clients to view a listing of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule of the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\nThe window opens with the amounts shown in the currency of commitment of the loan.  You may change the currency to US dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) or your local currency by selecting the desired currency from the \"Show Amounts in\" dropdown list.  Note that the amounts will be calculated using current exchange rates.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Special Accounts is shown under a special category listed as SA-X (e.g., SA-*, SA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Special Account shows the outstanding advance to the Special Account.  When the advances to the Special Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Special Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. When the Special Account is fully documented, both disbursed and undisbursed balances of the Special Account category become zero.  In some cases, a small balance in the Special Account category may exist after the Special Account is fully documented.  This represents the exchange rate fluctuation between the currency of commitment and the currency of the Special Account from the time of advances to the Special Account to the time of documentation of the Account. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 Search by Grant or Trust Fund Agreement and by Financing Agreement.",

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories.

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.

The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\nThe window opens with the amounts shown in the currency of commitment of the loan.  You may change the currency to US dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) or your local currency by selecting the desired currency from the \"Show Amounts in\" dropdown list.  Note that the amounts will be calculated using current exchange rates.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Special Accounts is shown under a special category listed as SA-X (e.g., SA-*, SA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Special Account shows the outstanding advance to the Special Account.  When the advances to the Special Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Special Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. When the Special Account is fully documented, both disbursed and undisbursed balances of the Special Account category become zero.  In some cases, a small balance in the Special Account category may exist after the Special Account is fully documented.  This represents the exchange rate fluctuation between the currency of commitment and the currency of the Special Account from the time of advances to the Special Account to the time of documentation of the Account.

  "description" : "The Category Schedule page allows World Bank clients to view a listing of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule of the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\nThe window opens with the amounts shown in the currency of commitment of the loan.  You may change the currency to US dollars (USD), Euros (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) or your local currency by selecting the desired currency from the \"Show Amounts in\" dropdown list.  Note that the amounts will be calculated using current exchange rates.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Special Accounts is shown under a special category listed as SA-X (e.g., SA-*, SA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Special Account shows the outstanding advance to the Special Account.  When the advances to the Special Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Special Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. When the Special Account is fully documented, both disbursed and undisbursed balances of the Special Account category become zero.  In some cases, a small balance in the Special Account category may exist after the Special Account is fully documented.  This represents the exchange rate fluctuation between the currency of commitment and the currency of the Special Account from the time of advances to the Special Account to the time of documentation of the Account. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 Search by Grant or Trust Fund Agreement and by Financing Agreement.",

  "description" : "This dataset represents the unaudited category schedule activity for the country of Moldova's current IBRD loans and IDA credits and grants. The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

The Category Schedule is a view of all categories and sub-categories shown in the withdrawal schedule as agreed to in the related Loan/Credit/Grant Agreements.  The Category Schedule provides a description of the items to be financed, the allocation of funds, the disbursed amount and the undisbursed balance for each category. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate comparison, all category schedule data in this dataset is shown in USD. However, the commitment currency of many loans/credits/grants may be in a currency other than USD.\r\n\r\nInformation regarding Designated Accounts is shown under a special category listed as DA-X (e.g., DA-*, DA-A) which has been created to keep track of advanced funds.  The disbursed amount under a Designated Account shows the outstanding advance to the Designated Account.  When the advances to the Designated Account are being documented, the disbursed amount under the Designated Account category reduces as the eligible expenditures are charged to related categories. Financing Agreements with more details about the loan, credit, grant or trust fund are available here: http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/docsearch/country/82547 .  TIP: Search by Grant or Loan Agreement and by Financing Agreement.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This data is released as part of a pilot with the Government of Moldova and represents an unaudited snapshot as of the date on which this data was captured (see ???Data As Of??? date of this dataset). There are timing differences between the disbursements made by the Bank and when and how the funds are used for actual project expenditures.",

Trusteeship does not involve overseeing or supervising the use of funds; this is the role of other agencies that receive the funding and who are responsible for project or program implementation.

  "description" : "Private sector development requires more than just finance. Experience shows the powerful role advisory services can play in unlocking investment and helping businesses expand and create jobs.\r\n \r\nTo help the private sector in emerging markets, IFC provides advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and governments. Our experience shows that companies need more than financial investment to thrive—they need a regulatory environment that enables entrepreneurship, and advice on business best practices. Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects.

Experience shows the powerful role advisory services can play in unlocking investment and helping businesses expand and create jobs.\r\n \r\nTo help the private sector in emerging markets, IFC provides advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and governments. Our experience shows that companies need more than financial investment to thrive—they need a regulatory environment that enables entrepreneurship, and advice on business best practices. Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects. We also help investment clients improve corporate governance and become more sustainable.\r\n\r\n We offer advice through nearly 1,100 Advisory Services staff in 85 offices across 73 countries. Funding comes from donor partners, IFC, and client contributions.",

Dans ce rôle d’administrateur, la Banque mondiale est tenue dans tous les cas de se conformer aux instructions des organes de gouvernance indépendants.\r\n\r\nDans l’exercice de ses responsabilités d’administrateur, la Banque mondiale veille en outre au respect de toutes sanctions pouvant s’appliquer à ses transactions.\r\n\r\nDe par l’aspect novateur de leurs mécanismes de financement et de gouvernance, les FIF permettent la mobilisation de fonds de sources multiples, comprenant aussi bien des entités souveraines que des intérêts privés. Leurs structures peuvent en outre être conçues sur mesure : certains FIF ont par exemple été structurés de manière à recevoir des contributions sous forme de prêts concessionnels, en plus des dons de type conventionnel ; et ils peuvent aussi recourir à des produits financiers sur mesure pour dispenser les fonds à leurs bénéficiaires.",

  "description" : "El desarrollo del sector privado requiere más que tan solo financiamiento. La experiencia muestra la importante función que pueden cumplir los servicios de asesoría a la hora de promover las inversiones y ayudar a las empresas a expandirse y crear puestos de trabajo. Para ayudar al sector privado en los mercados emergentes, IFC proporciona asesoramiento, mecanismos de solución de problemas y capacitación a las empresas, a los distintos sectores y a los Gobiernos. Su experiencia muestra que las empresas necesitan más que inversión financiera para prosperar, esto es, necesitan un entorno normativo que propicie los emprendimientos y asesoramiento sobre las mejores prácticas empresariales. Su tarea incluye el asesoramiento a los Gobiernos nacionales y locales sobre cómo mejorar el clima para la inversión y fortalecer la infraestructura básica. Los Gobiernos representan alrededor de la mitad de los proyectos de asesoría de IFC. Asimismo, la Corporación ayuda a los clientes en los que ha invertido a mejorar la gestión de gobierno y ser más sostenibles. Ofrece asesoría a través de los casi 1.100 funcionarios del Servicio de Asesoría que trabajan en 85 oficinas ubicadas en 73 países. Los fondos provienen de las contribuciones de los asociados donantes, IFC y los clientes. Más información en: http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/as_ext_content/what+we+do/advisory+services? .",

  "description" : "金融中介基金（FIF）是一种多边融资安排，由世行提供受托人服务，其中包括为项目实施方（通常为国际组织，例如多边开发银行或联合国机构）提供资金承诺和转账服务。世界银行作为受托人，在各种情况下均须依据独立理事会的指令行事。\r\n\r\n世界银行在履行受托人职责时遵循适用于世界银行交易的所有制裁。\r\n\r\nFIF利用创新的融资和治理结构，可从多个渠道筹资，包括主权和私人资金。FIF的结构可以定制调整。例如，有的FIF经过调整后，就可以在接受传统赠款基金的基础上，接受优惠贷款形式的捐助，从而能为受援方以定制金融产品方式提供资金。",

  "description" : "Для развития частного сектора нужны не только инвестиции. Опыт показывает, какую важную роль могут сыграть консультационные услуги в деле привлечения инвестиций и содействия росту предпринимательства и созданию рабочих мест. В рамках помощи частному сектору на развивающихся рынках IFC проводит для компаний, отраслей и правительств консультации, помогает им в решении проблем и проводит обучение. Наш опыт показал, что для успешного развития компаниям нужны не только инвестиции – им нужна благоприятная для предпринимательства нормативно-правовая база, а также консультации по наиболее эффективной практике ведения бизнеса. В сферу нашей деятельности входит консультирование национальных и местных властей по методам улучшения инвестиционного климата и совершенствования базовой инфраструктуры. На долю правительств приходится примерно половина наших консультационных проектов. Кроме того, мы помогаем клиентам, получающим инвестиции, улучшать корпоративное управление и становиться более устойчивыми. Консультации проводят примерно 1100 сотрудников в 85 отделениях, действующих в 73 странах. Финансирование осуществляется за счет средств доноров – партнеров, IFC, а также взносов клиентов.

  "description" : "Private sector development requires more than just finance. Experience shows the powerful role advisory services can play in unlocking investment and helping businesses expand and create jobs.\r\n \r\nTo help the private sector in emerging markets, IFC provides advice, problem solving, and training to companies, industries, and governments. Our experience shows that companies need more than financial investment to thrive—they need a regulatory environment that enables entrepreneurship, and advice on business best practices. Our work includes advising national and local governments on how to improve their investment climate and strengthen basic infrastructure. Governments account for around half of our advisory projects. We also help investment clients improve corporate governance and become more sustainable.\r\n\r\n We offer advice through nearly 1,100 Advisory Services staff in 85 offices across 73 countries. Funding comes from donor partners, IFC, and client contributions. Learn more at http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/as_ext_content/what+we+do/advisory+services? .",

  "description" : "Los fondos intermediarios financieros (FIF) son mecanismos financieros multilaterales a los que el Banco Mundial brinda servicios de depositario. Esto incluye comprometer y transferir fondos a los encargados de ejecutar los proyectos (por lo general, organismos internacionales como los bancos multilaterales de desarrollo o los organismos de las Naciones Unidas). En todos los casos, el Banco Mundial, en su calidad de depositario, debe actuar de conformidad con las instrucciones de los órganos rectores independientes.\r\n\r\nComo parte de sus responsabilidades como depositario, el Banco Mundial cumple con todas las sanciones aplicables a sus operaciones. \r\n\r\nLas decisiones de financiamiento constituyen los montos aprobados por los órganos rectores de los FIF para honorarios de proyectos y presupuestos administrativos. El financiamiento para proyectos puede concretarse mediante diferentes productos financieros, como donaciones y préstamos en condiciones concesionarias.",
