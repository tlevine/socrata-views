  "description" : "This dataset contains the current estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nFund Balance Available to Program: Includes property tax revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenue from prior years that remains after netting out previous project allocations. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nBond/Note Proceeds Available to Program: Funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender after accounting for prior project allocations, which may be allocated to projects in the current year.\r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

It reflects the City’s operating budget and anticipated grants at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2011. This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget. The data is extracted directly from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months, etc. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are counted; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months, etc. recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually.

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

These codes are also used to aggregate types of cases for statistical purposes.  In Illinois, the Illinois State Police establish IUCR codes, but the agencies can add codes to suit their individual needs.  The Chicago Police Department currently uses more than 350 IUCR codes to classify criminal offenses, divided into “Index” and “Non-Index” offenses.  Index offenses are the offenses that are collected nation-wide by the Federal Bureaus of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program to document crime trends over time (data released semi-annually), and include murder, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault & battery, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Non-index offenses are all other types of criminal incidents, including vandalism, weapons violations, public peace violations, etc.",

INSPECTION CATEGORY: Inspections are categorized by one of the following: COMPLAINT – Inspection is a result of a 311 Complaint PERIODIC – Inspection is a result of recurring inspection (typically on an annual cycle) PERMIT – Inspection is a result of a Permit REGISTRATION – Inspection is a result of a Registration (typically Vacant Building Registration) PROPERTY GROUP: Properties (lots) in the City of Chicago can typically have multiple point addresses, range addresses and buildings. Examples are corner lots, large lots, lots with front and rear buildings, etc.. As a result, inspections (and their associated violations), permits and complaints related to a single property could have different addresses. This problem can be reconciled by using Property Group. All point and range addresses for a property are assigned the same Property Group key.

  "description" : "Contracts and modifications awarded by the City of Chicago since 1993. This data is currently maintained in the City’s Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS), which is used throughout the City for contract management and payment. \r\nLegacy System Records: Purchase Order/Contract Numbers that begin with alpha characters identify records imported from legacy systems. Records with a null value in the Contract Type field were imported from legacy systems. \r\n\"Comptroller-Other\" Contract Type: Some records where the Contract Type is \"COMPTROLLER-OTHER\" are ordinance-based agreements and may have start dates earlier than 1993. \r\nDepends Upon Requirements Contracts: If the contract Award Amount is $0, the contract is not cancelled, and the contract is a blanket contract, then the contract award total Depends Upon Requirements. A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates. Standard contracts (for example, construction contracts) terminate upon completion and acceptance of all deliverables. These dates are tracked outside of FMPS. \r\n\r\nNegative Modifications: Some contracts are modified to delete scope and money from a contract. These reductions are indicated by negative numbers in the Award Amount field of this dataset. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Procurement Services. \r\nTime Period: 1993 to present. \r\nFrequency: Data is updated daily.",

Lobbyist registration information is submitted to the Board of Ethics in paper form and is available in its entirety in the Board's offices. The Board has, since 2000, compiled and posted static lists of all lobbyists and their clients online. Previous policy did not require the Board of Ethics to prioritize the reporting of all data available from paper filings. From this point forward, the Board of Ethics will electronically compile more data about lobbyists and their activities and automatically report this information online.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The TIF Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. This report is routinely updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. The TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period. Revenue items include: - FY Beginning cash balance – projected available funds at the beginning of the current fiscal year in each TIF. This includes uncommitted TIF funds from previous years and projected TIF revenue collections in the current fiscal year. - Estimated incremental property tax revenue – includes projected TIF revenue collections in each of the next two fiscal years (typically based on the previous year’s collection information). - Port – allowable per state law, these are funds that are shifted from one TIF to an adjoining TIF for specific projects (those projects are listed). Expenditure/cost items include: - Appropriated, committed, requested, or pending projects/costs to be funded with TIF resources in various stages of commitment and approval. - Appropriated: Projects for which funds have been approved and budgeted and for which funds are available to spend. - Committed: Projects that have been approved but for which funding has not yet been formally identified and/or approved. In some cases where dollar amounts are listed, those dollar amounts indicate an estimate of how much funding may be needed. - Pending: Projects that are currently under consideration but not yet approved. In some cases dollar amounts are listed that reflect estimated project costs. - Requested: Projects that have been listed based on discussions with outside parties. Estimated costs/funding have been identified for these projects. - Administrative costs – allowable per state law, these are costs incurred by the City related to the implementation and administration of TIF redevelopment plans, including but not limited to staff costs.",

Graffiti Blasters employ \"blast\" trucks that use baking soda under high water pressure to erase painted graffiti from brick, stone and other mineral surfaces. They also use paint trucks to cover graffiti on the remaining surfaces. Organizations and residents may report graffiti and request its removal.\r\n311 sometimes receives duplicate requests for graffiti removal. Requests that have been labeled as Duplicates are in the same geographic area and have been entered into 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system at around the same time as a previous request. Duplicate reports/requests are labeled as such in the Status field, as either \"Open - Dup\" or \"Completed - Dup.\" Data is updated daily.",

  "description" : "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \r\n\r\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\r\n\r\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Transportation.

  "description" : "This dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads. For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

The dataset is excerpted from the 2012 Budget Recommendations, which is the line-item budget proposed by the Mayor to the City Council for approval. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually. For more information about the budget process, visit the Budget Documents page: http://j.mp/lPotWf.",

CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. \r\n \r\nWhenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).” Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, any “Duplicate (Open)” address will automatically be observed and repaired. \r\n \r\nOnce the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor.

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "This dataset contains Aboveground Storage Tank (AST) and Underground Storage Tank (UST) information from the Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Tank Asset Database. The Tank Asset Database contains tank information from CDPH AST and UST permit applications as well as UST records imported from the historic Department of Environment (DOE) database. This dataset also includes AST records from the historic DOE and pre-1992 UST records from the Building Department. \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n TANK TYPE:  Specifies if the asset is an Underground Storage Tank or an Aboveground Storage Tank.  \r\nFACILITY ID: This is the unique identifier of the facility. A UST Facility ID that is seven digits long and begins with the number ‘2’ is a Facility ID assigned by the Office of the State Fire Marshall (OSFM). All other IDs were assigned by the DOE or CDPH based on the facility address.   \r\nOWNER: The owner of record for the tank. For State-regulated USTs, this is the owner registered with the OSFM. \r\nFACILITY NAME: This is the name given to the facility. This is usually the company/owner name, building name or address.  \r\nTANK ID: This is a numeric ID that uniquely identifies a particular tank at the facility. \r\nTANK MATERIAL: Specifies the type of material the tank is made of. \r\nTANK PRODUCT: Specifies the type of product stored in the tank.    \r\nTANK CAPACITY: This is the storage volume of the tank in gallons. \r\nINSTALLATION DATE: The date the tank was installed at the facility if known. For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nREMOVAL DATE: The date the tank was removed from the facility if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nLAST USED DATE: The date the tank was last in service if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nCOMMENT: Contains additional information on the tank that may include supplemental location information; field observations; removal, abandonment, or last used dates; permitting notes; and other miscellaneous information. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.",

Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

On July 28, 2011, this requirement was enacted into law by the City Council, as Section 2-156-015 of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance (effective September 8, 2011) http://bit.ly/qYti7P. The law requires new hires or appointees to sign the pledge within 14 days of starting their employment or appointments.  The pledge obligates signers to abide by a ban on lobbying activity for two years after their City service ends.  The Board of Ethics maintains these signed pledges.  As a convenience, we are pleased to attach a list of persons who have signed this pledge.  This list is sortable by name and department.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2012.This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually.

  "description" : "When moisture seeps into pavement, it expands when it freezes and contracts when it thaws.  This flexing of the pavement, combined with the melted water and the stress of vehicular traffic, causes pavement to deteriorate and potholes to form.  The Department of Transportation (CDOT) responds to potholes reported through 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system by mapping open pothole requests each morning and routing crews in geographic clusters so as to fill as many potholes as possible per day.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete pothole repairs per week.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for pothole repairs is within 7 days.  For more information about pothole repairs, see CDOT’s pothole Frequently Asked Questions page: http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/PotholeFAQ_winter1011.pdf",

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH. \r\nThis dataset also contains No Further Remediation Letters (NFRs) received by the DOE or the CDPH for properties that have been cleaned up under the Illinois Environmental Protections Agency’s (IEPA) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) program.\r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nAPPLICATION ID:  Unique identifier of record.\r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\nTYPE: Specifies the type of permit hold placed on a property or the hold released on an individual permit.  HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT is a permit hold placed on construction projects in the public right-of-way at certain locations in the City of Chicago. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/bn3grwt for more information. A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD is a permit hold placed on select properties in the Streeterville area for thorium contamination. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/d6wth39 . A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD RELEASE indicates that an applicant has complied with the necessary requirements and the Thorium Permit Hold has been lifted on the permit application. An NFR LUST is not a permit hold but the property may have certain land use restrictions or requirements (i.e. institutional or engineering controls) to prevent or minimize exposure of contaminants that may still be present at the property.\r\nDATE: Date the record was entered into the database. \r\nCOMMENT: Comments relating to the hold or release. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that placed or released the hold.",

  "description" : "Every year your Cook County government budgets and spends more than $3 billion. Your County's budget impacts your life every day. All of its funding comes from you - your sales and property taxes, your purchase fees on gas and other goods. All of its spending exists to support you, too. County funding drives the forest preserve district, the jail, public hospitals and clinics, the Cook County courts and dozens of other civic institutions designed to make our region prosperous, efficient and fair.\n\nYet too many residents don't understand what Cook County government is or what it does. They keep asking, \"where exactly does our money go?\"\n\nCommissioner John Fritchey created this budget transparency tool to answer that question, but it's only a first step. We need your help. What questions do you have about County spending? What do you want to know about the County budget that this visualization isn't explaining to you? What do you think of our spending? What can we do to make Cook County government better?",

  "description" : "This dataset and corresponding map provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n DOCKET NO:  This the unique identifier assigned to the case. A docket number can contain multiple tickets. \r\nTICKET NO: This is the unique identifier of the issued ticket. A ticket can contain up to two code violations.\r\nRESPONDENT: The name of the entity issued the code violation notice.  \r\nCASE TYPE: The Case Types are historic 3-Day Notice, Air Pollution Defect Notice, Administrative Hearing, Summary Abatement, Chicago Storage Tank NOV, State Administrative Citation, State Violation Notice, historic Pre Enforcement Conference, and historic Ticket-Municipal Prosecution.\t\r\nVIOLATION DATE: The date of the code violation.  \r\nCODE VIOLATION: The municipal or state code being cited in the ticket. \r\nDISPOSITION: The outcome of the individual code violation. \r\nCASE STATUS: The final or most current status of the case.   \r\nFINE AMONT: This is the total fine assessed for the case not including court fees. Note that this value is not unique to the record but applies to the entire case. For example, the case with a Docket No of 07DE000171 has two records with a Fine Amount of $350 in each record. The total fine on the case is $350, not the sum of $700.\r\nCOMMENT: Additional information relating to the violation or case. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.",

  "description" : "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. Whenever CDOT receives a report from 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system of an “All Out” (an outage of 3 or more lights) the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete street lights “All Out” requests.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for street light “All Out” repairs is within 4 days.  To report a street light outage, call 311 or see http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/traffic_signals_andstreetlights/svcs/request_street_lights.html",

  "description" : "The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940.  During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey:\r\n\r\n1.\tA color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance.  This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: \"Red\" and \"Orange.\"  Buildings and structures coded \"Red\" or \"Orange\" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago’s Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003.\r\n\r\n2.\tOnly buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented.  Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded.  If an “Orange”- or “Red”-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map.  The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as “Orange” or “Red;” however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as “Orange” or “Red.”\r\n\r\nAdditional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.\r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, is required.

Projects that include green technologies (green roofs, rainwater harvesting, solar panels, solar thermal panels, wind turbine and geothermal systems) are required to be submitted through the Green Permit Program.  This metric tracks the average number of days DOB takes to process individual Green Permits, grouped by the week the permit was processed. The target average process time is within 71 days.",

  "description" : "Customers applying for a Building permit will create a web-based on-line Building permit application.  As part of an initial review within the Building permit process, the zoning plan examination will be conducted to ensure compliance with the City of Chicago’s Zoning Ordinance which regulates land use.  The applicant is able to schedule and be seen by a zoning plan examiner on average within two (2) business days from the date of the on-line application.  An applicant may receive zoning approval within the first scheduled appointment if they have followed the instructions and do not require administrative relief for their project.  If administrative relief or corrections are required, the applicant can re-submit the application for immediate review and approval upon completion of the corrections or administrative process.  An applicant typically requires two plan review visits before the Department of Housing and Economic Development is able to approve the zoning part of the building permit.",

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago.  This dataset is in KML format. To view or use these files, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.\r\n\r\nThis information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite.  The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery.  Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required.  These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage).\r\n\r\nThe results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs.  A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago.  The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet.  The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1).  The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

For more information about CDPH’s lead poisoning prevention programs, or to report elevated blood lead levels, see the Environmental Health Division at http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/environ_health.html",

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is in ESRI shapefile format. To view or use these files, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS, is required. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "description" : "This metric tracks the number of children and families receiving early childhood and school aged services per month. School vacations influence monthly enrollment, for example, CPS is closed in July. DFSS funds programs providing education and early childhood development activities for children up to 12 years old from low income families. Early childhood services for children age 0 to 5 include free medical, dental and mental health services, and nutritious meals, as well as parent education and training. These programs promote school readiness and child development. For children 6-12, DFSS provides low-income families access to affordable, quality childcare that allows parents to continue to work or participate in approved training programs.",

  "category" : "Transportation",
  "createdAt" : 1363976325,
  "description" : "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for  1270 traffic segments. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/Vz3rIh.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

CDPH maintains drop-in STI Specialty Clinics & HIV Early Intervention Services in South Austin, Englewood, Roseland, Lakeview and West Town that diagnose and treat STIs and provide information about condom use and other STI prevention methods.  These clinics are offered at no cost, and on a first-come, first-serve basis.  This metric tracks the percent of patients served by the STI Specialty Clinics per month out of the total number of people who seek care.

The Department works in partnership with these agencies: 12 not-for-profit corporations and one unit of local government, the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nArea Agencies have the primary task of planning and coordinating services and programs for older people in their respective areas. The Area Agencies receive funding from the Department based on a formula which takes into consideration the number of older citizens and minorities in that area, as well as the number living in poverty, in rural areas, and alone. \r\n\r\nLike the Department on Aging, Area Agencies are not, as a rule, direct service providers. Area Agencies contract with local agencies which provide services to the older people who live in the same community.",

  "description" : "The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940. During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance. \nPlease note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey: \n\n1.\tA color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance. This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: \"Red\" and \"Orange.\" Buildings and structures coded \"Red\" or \"Orange\" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago’s Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003. \n\n2.\tOnly buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented. Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded. If an “Orange”- or “Red”-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map. The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as “Orange” or “Red;” however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as “Orange” or “Red.” \n\nAdditional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.\n\nTo view or use this KMZ file, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as Google Earth, are required.

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "No new tavern licenses can be issued to any location that is within 400 feet of existing businesses already licensed for the sale of alcoholic liquor in certain zoning districts. Measurements are made from the property line and exclude streets, alleys, and public ways. This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs.\r\n\r\nThere are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: •\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. •\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. •\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",
