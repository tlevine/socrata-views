Utilizing the Genealogical Research Death Index will narrow the search to the individual's death record certificate number, thereby minimizing the cost to the consumer.  This Index contains information on decedents, parents, date of death, gender, age at death and NYS file number. Processing of a genealogy request by the NYS DOH may take eight (8) months or longer. If the municipality where the event took place is known, submitting your request directly to the local registrar or municipal clerk may save considerable time.

Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population.

Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample).

Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. \r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample).

  "description" : "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

Some key survey items have been included since inception (e.g., current smoking status); some questions may be included for a shorter period of time to assess a time-sensitive issue (e.g., support for tax increase), and other questions may be rotated in and out of the survey instrument as deemed necessary."

Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

Participating programs in CACFP are child care centers, including Head Start centers, outside school hours programs serving children through age twelve in licensed or registered non-residential settings, after school programs providing educational or enrichment programming for children up to nineteen years of age in low income areas, community-based adult day care centers that are approved by federal, state or local authorities to provide day care services to functionally impaired adults through individualized care plans and home-based family and group child care.  The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents. The EWPH-DCH (East Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes) project was designed as an educational and environmental change program with DCH (Day Care Home) providers as the primary target audience and the children and their parents as the secondary target audiences.

While this may seem like an error, plan significance ratings are based on how much a plan's rate differs from the statewide average and the number of individuals included in the rate. Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

  "description" : "The point map shows the obesity rate by grade level for public school districts in New York State, exclusive of New York City, from the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR). The initial view of the map is broken up into large geographic areas and displays the number of public school districts in each area. To drill down to a smaller geographic area, click directly on the area of the map or click the plus sign to zoom in on the map. The small blue dots represent school district offices, not the location of specific schools. Clicking on a dot will bring up a fly-out for that district, with information about the obesity rate, grade level, county, region and school years. You can click “next” on the fly-out to view the rate for all three grade levels (elementary, middle/high and district total). Please note that if the obesity rate value is blank on a given flyout, it means that obesity data for this school district and grade level could not be reported to the NYSDOH due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). For more information on FERPA, please refer to the Student Weight Overview document by clicking on the \"About\" tab. The map can be filtered by grade level by changing the options under the Filter tab. Removing the school district filter is not recommended. The map is based on data collected through the SWSCR.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

As a result, certain sites may not show data for all years/report periods.  The dataset does not represent nor does it include data collected by other programs.  The datasets are organized by sites and include only samples found at those sites.  Missing data is typically due to missing or damaged devices, so as to be unreadable.  "

Therefore, plans can have the same rate but have different significance ratings because their rates are based on different numbers of enrollees."

The denominators for certain indicators are small (i.e., PCP prophylaxis) because eligible populations for these indicators are reduced. The vast majority of HIV ambulatory care programs (>90%) have self‐reported their performance data and are included in this report. Blank data fields occur for three reasons: (i) if there were five (5) or fewer patients eligible for a single indicator, these data were redacted to protect confidentiality; (ii) indicators with insufficient spread are not categorized by quintile; and (iii) some fields, such as facility type, are not applicable for aggregated (regional or statewide) entries."

        "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the district, county and regional-level estimates may vary. New York City school districts are exempt from the NYS Education Law 903 and 904 that established the SWSCR system. Therefore this dataset excludes public school districts from the five boroughs of New York City (Brooklyn, Kings, New York, Queens, and Richmond).

Each partner’s address, phone number and in many cases e-mail contact are provided.The Prevention Agenda 2013-17 is New York State’s health improvement plan for 2013 through 2017. This plan involves a unique mix of organizations including local health departments, health care providers, health plans, community based organizations, advocacy groups, academia, employers as well as state agencies, schools, and businesses whose activities can influence the health of individuals and communities and address health disparities. This unprecedented collaboration is designed to demonstrate how communities across the state can work together to improve the health and quality of life for all New Yorkers. The purpose of the dataset is to provide the public, health providers and tentative DOH partners with some basic information about who in NYS is working on prevention agenda related items.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

        "Notes" : "The SWSCR dataset includes weight status data collected from all public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC. The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.       public school districts outside of the five boroughs of NYC.

Note that the results for the \"Fence Line at Waste Area\" location are elevated compared to other locations.  Elevated radiation levels are expected at this monitoring location due to its proximity to a High Level Radioactive Waste Storage Facility.  This is an on-site location. Access to this location is controlled by the site operator.  Based on historical data and changes in site activities, monitoring at several locations was discontinued in July 2012 and going forward.  Present locations monitored, in addition to the \"Fence Line at Waste Area,\" are \"Rock Spring Road\" and \"Springville-Erie County.\"  Monitoring for this location was done in 1995 only.  If a grey broken column appears, this means data was not collected for that instance.

Please note that this program is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack).

  "description" : "This map displays the location and performance data for all participating clinics.  The view defaults to a high-level map of the Eastern United States with the entire HIVQUAL data set represented by a large red dot over New York State.  Clicking repeatedly on this dot zooms the view into New York, and as the view narrows the single dot is replaced by multiple dots that represent smaller clusters of sites.  (Red dots represent aggregated samples of 1000 or more; orange dots represent 100 to 999 patients; and yellow dots represent up to 99 patients).\r\n\r\nEach of these dots may be clicked in turn, which zooms the view into that area.  Data are eventually displayed at the level of individual clinics, which are represented by small blue dots.  Clicking on any of these generates a \"flyout\" text box that contains the program's name, its facility type, and the name, score and performance quintile for the current indicator.  Clicking \"view details for this row\" will display the entire data point in a table view below the map, including the street address for the clinic.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible to scroll through the performance for each indicator by clicking repeatedly on the \"Next\" link in the flyout, it will usually be more convenient to filter the map data to focus on a particular indicator.  This can be done by typing a portion of the indicator name in the \"Indicator Name contains\" text box to the right of the map and then checking the box just to the left of that field.  For example, filtering on \"domestic\" will limit the display to the \"Domestic violence screening\" indicator.  Additional filtering options are provided that allow for focusing on particular types of facilities (e.g., just community health centers) and/or sites that score above any desired threshold value.\r\n\r\nIn addition to common map navigation options including using the mouse to drag the view or dragging a sliding scale to zoom in or out, there is a button with an arrow and crossed lines that provides a \"navigate to here\" feature.  Entering a street address will refocus the map on that location, and the user can then zoom out to see clinics in that area.\"",

  "description" : "The DOH Radon Program contracts with a radon testing laboratory to provide short-term charcoal radon test kits, radon test kit analysis and results to residents.   The contract laboratory provides the radon test results to the individual home owner and the DOH Radon Program. All testing data is entered into our database. From this database, we are able to create radon prevalence maps, design special outreach activities and campaigns, and track the location in the home where the detector was placed.  \r\n\r\nThe radon test results obtained from this database may not be reflective of all radon tests completed in New York State. There are approximately 30,000-40,000 radon tests completed each year in New York State that are not purchased through the NYSDOH Radon Program. These tests are completed by resident home owners, inspectors, schools, etc. across the state.  A map by town is currently not available, but users can view a map by county.  The county map is Radon Test Results By County: Beginning 1987 and can be accessed from the main catalog.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/radiological/radon/radon.htm or go to the \"About\" tab.",

The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Priority areas include Chronic Disease; Health and Safe Environment; Healthy Women, Infants and Children; Mental Health and Substance Abuse; and HIV, STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare Associated Infections.  Along with the name of each indicator are given the baseline year, the baseline year value of the indicator, and the Prevention Agenda 2017 target for the indicator. Sub-indicators are included in this dataset to measure health disparities among racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and persons with disabilities.

The NY NATS assesses (a) adult tobacco-related behavior, attitudes, and beliefs; (b) tobacco purchasing and cessation attempt behavior; (c) health status and health-related problems; (d) attitudes toward and exposure to secondhand smoke; (e) perceptions of risk related to tobacco use; (f) exposure to tobacco advertising or anti-tobacco health communications; and (g) attitudes toward other smoking policies. Some key survey items have been included since inception (e.g., current smoking status); some questions may be included for a shorter period of time to assess a time-sensitive issue (e.g., support for tax increase), and other questions may be rotated in and out of the survey instrument as deemed necessary."

The dataset contains information submitted by New York State Article 28 Hospitals as part of the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative (SPARCS) and Institutional Cost Report (ICR) data submissions. The dataset contains information on the volume of discharges, All Payer Refined Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG), the severity of illness level (SOI), medical or surgical classification the median charge, median cost, average charge and average cost per discharge. When interpreting New York’s data, it is important to keep in mind that variations in cost may be attributed to many factors.

The dataset is a valid source of information about variation in overweight and obesity in public school districts outside of New York City.  However, because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make absolute comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.  Data are aggregated to New York State Department of Education county code assigned to reporting schools and school districts, and to NYSDOH regions and statewide.  Because school district boundaries do not align with county or regional boundaries, the county- and regional-level estimates reflect data from students attending school within schools assigned a particular county or regional code.  County and regional assignment is not based on county or region of residence. The estimates represent the percentage of students reported within a weight status category, which reflects data reported to the Student Weight Status Category Reporting System. These data should not be considered to represent all school aged-children attending school in a district, county or region because of: restrictions in reporting due to FERPA, especially parents/guardians ability to request that their child's weight status data be excluded from reporting and other sources of missing data.

  "description" : "This dataset measures the air, water, milk, and fallout at Background sites around NYS to determine the normal levels of radioactivity and monitors the influence of human activities on these levels. Background samples are collected statewide from several sites which are not expected to be influenced by discharges of radionuclides to the environment.  The site numbers represent the location from which samples are collected. This dataset is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation). A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.

This dataset excludes Child and Adult Care Food Program participation provided at homeless shelters and legally-exempt day care home providers.  \n\nNot all counties in NYS are serviced by the grantees implementing the project EWPHCSS. \n\nThe EWPHDCH project is currently limited to the areas served by the contracted agencies. \n\nThe Child and Adult Care Food Program dataset is related to the Child Care Related Programs dataset on the www.Open.ny.gov website, however this dataset includes additional nutrition information.  The Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is currently working to update the Child Care Related Programs dataset on a more frequent schedule with the OPEN NY team.  OCFS and DOH will then be able to synchronize in the near future.  Temporarily, DOH has omitted addresses for regulated child care providers that provide home care since this information is available on www.Open.ny.gov by using this link: https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz.   \n\n For more information, please visit http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/cacfp/ or go to the \"About\" tab.\n\nThis data set is available at: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Child-And-Adult-Care-Food-Program-Participation-Be/dmn7-mpa8",

        "Notes" : "The participating sites in the dataset are based on approved applications to the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Applications are reviewed daily and program participation is frequently changing.  Participating programs in CACFP are child care centers, including Head Start centers, outside school hours programs serving children through age twelve in licensed or registered non-residential settings, after school programs providing educational or enrichment programming for children up to nineteen years of age in low income areas, community-based adult day care centers that are approved by federal, state or local authorities to provide day care services to functionally impaired adults through individualized care plans and home-based family and group child care.  The EWPHCCS (Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings) project provides funding to implement a nutrition and physical activity curriculum designed for pre-school children and their parents. The EWPH-DCH (East Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes) project was designed as an educational and environmental change program with DCH (Day Care Home) providers as the primary target audience and the children and their parents as the secondary target audiences.   This dataset is currently updated quarterly.  "

The default view of the chart shows the health tracking indicator “Chlamydia case rate per 100,000 women - Aged 15-44 years.” To show only certain counties in the chart, enter the names of the counties in the county filter under the Filter tab. A different health tracking indicator can be viewed by selecting another indicator under the Filter tab.

  "description" : "This dataset measures the air, water, milk, fish, sediment, and fruit/veg near Ginna Station and other locations(background) around NYS to determine the normal levels of radioactivity and monitors the influence of human activities on these levels. The site numbers represent the location from which samples are collected. This dataset is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation). A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.

  "description" : "This is a graph of the cesium- 137 concentration in fish near the Nine Mile Point and James A. Fitzpatrick facilities. You can view other years by changing the \"Sample date\" filter and typing in the year you wish to view. You can view the concentration for other isotopes by changing the \"Isotope\" filter.  Increases in concentration during March and April 2011 is due to the Fukushima accident. Increases that do not have a comment are within normal ranges. A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.
