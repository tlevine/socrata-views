  "description" : "This dataset contains the current estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nFund Balance Available to Program: Includes property tax revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenue from prior years that remains after netting out previous project allocations. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nBond/Note Proceeds Available to Program: Funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender after accounting for prior project allocations, which may be allocated to projects in the current year.\r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years.

To protect the privacy of the individuals, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. The data are extracted from the CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system developed by the Department.\r\nAlthough every effort is made to keep this list accurate and current, the city cannot guarantee the accuracy of this information. Offenders may have moved and failed to notify the Chicago Police Department as required by law. If any information presented in this web site is known to be outdated, please contact the Chicago Police Department at srwbmstr@chicagopolice.org, or mail to Sex Registration Unit, 3510 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60653.\r\nDisclaimer: This registry is based upon the legislature's decision to facilitate access to publicly available information about persons convicted of specific sexual offenses. The Chicago Police Department has not considered or assessed the specific risk of re-offense with regard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion within this registry, and has made no determination that any individual included within the registry is currently dangerous. Individuals included within this registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and Illinois law. The main purpose of providing this data on the internet is to make the information more available and accessible, not to warn about any specific individual. \r\n\r\nAnyone who uses information contained in the Sex Offender Database to commit a criminal act against another person is subject to criminal prosecution.\r\nData Owner: Chicago Police Department.\r\nFrequency: Data is updated daily.\r\nRelated Applications: CLEARMAP (http://j.mp/lLluSa).",

The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually.

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

These codes are also used to aggregate types of cases for statistical purposes.  In Illinois, the Illinois State Police establish IUCR codes, but the agencies can add codes to suit their individual needs.  The Chicago Police Department currently uses more than 350 IUCR codes to classify criminal offenses, divided into “Index” and “Non-Index” offenses.  Index offenses are the offenses that are collected nation-wide by the Federal Bureaus of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program to document crime trends over time (data released semi-annually), and include murder, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault & battery, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.  Non-index offenses are all other types of criminal incidents, including vandalism, weapons violations, public peace violations, etc.",

  "description" : "Violations issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present. The dataset contains more than 1 million records/rows of data and cannot be viewed in full in Microsoft Excel. Therefore, when downloading the file, select CSV from the Export menu. Open the file in an ASCII text editor, such as Wordpad, to view and search. Violations are always associated to an inspection and there can be multiple violation records to one(1) inspection record. Data fields requiring description are detailed below. VIOLATION DATE: The date the violation was cited. INSPECTION CATEGORY: Inspections are categorized by one of the following: COMPLAINT – Inspection is a result of a 311 Complaint PERIODIC – Inspection is a result of recurring inspection (typically on an annual cycle) PERMIT – Inspection is a result of a Permit REGISTRATION – Inspection is a result of a Registration (typically Vacant Building Registration) PROPERTY GROUP: Properties (lots) in the City of Chicago can typically have multiple point addresses, range addresses and buildings. Examples are corner lots, large lots, lots with front and rear buildings, etc.. As a result, inspections (and their associated violations), permits and complaints related to a single property could have different addresses. This problem can be reconciled by using Property Group. All point and range addresses for a property are assigned the same Property Group key.

  "description" : "Contracts and modifications awarded by the City of Chicago since 1993. This data is currently maintained in the City’s Financial Management and Purchasing System (FMPS), which is used throughout the City for contract management and payment. \r\nLegacy System Records: Purchase Order/Contract Numbers that begin with alpha characters identify records imported from legacy systems. Records with a null value in the Contract Type field were imported from legacy systems. \r\n\"Comptroller-Other\" Contract Type: Some records where the Contract Type is \"COMPTROLLER-OTHER\" are ordinance-based agreements and may have start dates earlier than 1993. \r\nDepends Upon Requirements Contracts: If the contract Award Amount is $0, the contract is not cancelled, and the contract is a blanket contract, then the contract award total Depends Upon Requirements. A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates. Standard contracts (for example, construction contracts) terminate upon completion and acceptance of all deliverables. These dates are tracked outside of FMPS. \r\n\r\nNegative Modifications: Some contracts are modified to delete scope and money from a contract. These reductions are indicated by negative numbers in the Award Amount field of this dataset. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Procurement Services. \r\nTime Period: 1993 to present. \r\nFrequency: Data is updated daily.",

  "description" : "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees the patching of potholes on over 4,000 miles of arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT receives reports of potholes through the 311 call center and uses a computerized mapping and tracking system to identify pothole locations and efficiently schedule crews.  One call to 311 can generate multiple pothole repairs. When a crew arrives to repair a 311 pothole, it fills all the other potholes within the block.  Pothole repairs are generally completed within 7 days from the first report of a pothole to 311. Weather conditions, particularly frigid temps and precipitation, influence how long a repair takes.  On days when weather is cooperative and there is no precipitation, crews can fill several thousand potholes.  \r\n\r\nIf a previous request is already open for a buffer of 4 addresses the request is given the status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".  For example, if there is an existing CSR for 6535 N Western and a new request is received for 6531 N Western (which is within four addresses of the original CSR) then the new request is given a status of \"Duplicate (Open)\".\r\n\r\nOnce the street is repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and \"Duplicate (Closed)\" for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported address is inspected but no potholes are found or have already been filled.  If another issue is found with the street, such as a “cave-in” or “failed utility cut”, then it is directed to the appropriate department or contractor. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Transportation.

  "description" : "This dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads. For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes.

The dataset is excerpted from the 2012 Budget Recommendations, which is the line-item budget proposed by the Mayor to the City Council for approval. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management.

CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. \r\n \r\nWhenever CDOT receives a report of an “All Out” the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly. If a second request of lights out in the same circuit is made within four calendar days of the original request, the newest request is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).” Since CDOT's electrician will be looking at all the lights in a circuit to verify that they are all working, any “Duplicate (Open)” address will automatically be observed and repaired. \r\n \r\nOnce the street lights are repaired, the status in CSR will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests.  A service request also receives the status of “Completed” when the reported lights are inspected but found to be in good repair and functioning; when the service request is for a non-existent address; or when the lights are maintained by a contractor.

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "This dataset contains Aboveground Storage Tank (AST) and Underground Storage Tank (UST) information from the Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Tank Asset Database. The Tank Asset Database contains tank information from CDPH AST and UST permit applications as well as UST records imported from the historic Department of Environment (DOE) database. This dataset also includes AST records from the historic DOE and pre-1992 UST records from the Building Department. \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n TANK TYPE:  Specifies if the asset is an Underground Storage Tank or an Aboveground Storage Tank.  \r\nFACILITY ID: This is the unique identifier of the facility. A UST Facility ID that is seven digits long and begins with the number ‘2’ is a Facility ID assigned by the Office of the State Fire Marshall (OSFM). All other IDs were assigned by the DOE or CDPH based on the facility address.   \r\nOWNER: The owner of record for the tank. For State-regulated USTs, this is the owner registered with the OSFM. \r\nFACILITY NAME: This is the name given to the facility. This is usually the company/owner name, building name or address.  \r\nTANK ID: This is a numeric ID that uniquely identifies a particular tank at the facility. \r\nTANK MATERIAL: Specifies the type of material the tank is made of. \r\nTANK PRODUCT: Specifies the type of product stored in the tank.    \r\nTANK CAPACITY: This is the storage volume of the tank in gallons. \r\nINSTALLATION DATE: The date the tank was installed at the facility if known. For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nREMOVAL DATE: The date the tank was removed from the facility if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nLAST USED DATE: The date the tank was last in service if known.  For some records, this information is in the COMMENTS column.\r\nCOMMENT: Contains additional information on the tank that may include supplemental location information; field observations; removal, abandonment, or last used dates; permitting notes; and other miscellaneous information. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

It requires Shakman-exempt employees of Executive Departments, department heads, non-clerical employees of the Mayor's Office, and persons appointed by the Mayor to City boards, commissions, authorities or agencies on or after May 16, 2011, to sign an Ethics Pledge http://bit.ly/mSkLU1. On July 28, 2011, this requirement was enacted into law by the City Council, as Section 2-156-015 of the Governmental Ethics Ordinance (effective September 8, 2011) http://bit.ly/qYti7P. The law requires new hires or appointees to sign the pledge within 14 days of starting their employment or appointments.  The pledge obligates signers to abide by a ban on lobbying activity for two years after their City service ends.  The Board of Ethics maintains these signed pledges.  As a convenience, we are pleased to attach a list of persons who have signed this pledge.  This list is sortable by name and department.",

It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management.

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nCOMPLAINT ID:  This is the unique identifier of the complaint incident. \r\nCOMPLAINT TYPE: Specifies the type of complaint. CDPH complaint types are  “Abandoned Site”, “Air Pollution Work Order”, “Asbestos Work Order”, “Construction and Demolition”, “Toxics Hazardous Materials Work Order”, ”Illegal Dumping Work Order”, “Noise Complaint”, “Permits Issued by DOE Work Order”, “Recycling Work Order”, “Service Stations/Storage Tanks Work Order”, “Vehicle Idling Work Order”, and “Water Pollution.” For consistency, historic DOE complaint types were renamed to match the most appropriate CDPH complaint type. DOE complaint types that had no matches are designated as “Other.”  \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n INSPECTOR: Contains the badge or ID number of the inspector or engineer who conducted the compliant inspection. \r\nCOMPLAINT DATE: Date complaint was received by the department. \r\nCOMPLAINT DETAIL: Brief description of the nature of the complaint.  \r\nINSPECTION LOG: This is the inspector’s narrative log of the complaint inspection.\r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.",

  "description" : "Permits issued by the Department of Environment (DOE) from January 1993 to December 31, 2011 and by the Department of Public Health (CDPH) since January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nAPPLICATION ID:  This is the unique id of the issued permit. Permits from the historic DOE are prefixed with “DOE.” Permits issued by CDPH are prefixed with “ENV_”\r\nAPPLICATION NAME: This is the name of the site that is being permitted. This is usually the company/owner name, address, or building name.  \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n APPLICATION TYPE:       \r\n\"ABOVEGROUND STORAGE TANK\" Permits to install or remove an Above Ground Storage Tank (AST) for dispensing and non-dispensing with a volume greater than 110 gallons.

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2012.This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually.

  "description" : "This dataset contains all open 311 reports of one or two lights out on metal poles on a residential or arterial street and all completed requests since January 1, 2011. Whenever CDOT receives a report of a street light outage, the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in a group (circuit) to make sure that they are working properly.  If two requests regarding the same group are made within 30 calendar days of each other, the newest CSR is automatically given the status of “Duplicate (Open).”   Since the electrician will be looking at all the lights in a group to verify that they are all working the “Duplicate (Open)” address will also be observed and repaired.  Once the street lights are repaired, the CSR status will read “Completed” for the original request and “Duplicate (Closed)” for any duplicate requests. Data is updated daily.",

  "description" : "When moisture seeps into pavement, it expands when it freezes and contracts when it thaws.  This flexing of the pavement, combined with the melted water and the stress of vehicular traffic, causes pavement to deteriorate and potholes to form.  The Department of Transportation (CDOT) responds to potholes reported through 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system by mapping open pothole requests each morning and routing crews in geographic clusters so as to fill as many potholes as possible per day.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete pothole repairs per week.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for pothole repairs is within 7 days.  For more information about pothole repairs, see CDOT’s pothole Frequently Asked Questions page: http://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/cdot/PotholeFAQ_winter1011.pdf",

On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH. \r\nThis dataset also contains No Further Remediation Letters (NFRs) received by the DOE or the CDPH for properties that have been cleaned up under the Illinois Environmental Protections Agency’s (IEPA) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) program.\r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nAPPLICATION ID:  Unique identifier of record.\r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\nTYPE: Specifies the type of permit hold placed on a property or the hold released on an individual permit.  HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT is a permit hold placed on construction projects in the public right-of-way at certain locations in the City of Chicago. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/bn3grwt for more information. A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD is a permit hold placed on select properties in the Streeterville area for thorium contamination. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/d6wth39 . A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD RELEASE indicates that an applicant has complied with the necessary requirements and the Thorium Permit Hold has been lifted on the permit application. An NFR LUST is not a permit hold but the property may have certain land use restrictions or requirements (i.e. institutional or engineering controls) to prevent or minimize exposure of contaminants that may still be present at the property.\r\nDATE: Date the record was entered into the database. \r\nCOMMENT: Comments relating to the hold or release. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that placed or released the hold.",

  "description" : "This dataset and corresponding map provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "description" : "Municipal and State code violation notices issued by the Department of Environment (DOE) from January, 1993 to December 31, 2012 and by the Department of Public Health (CDPH) Permitting and Inspections unit since January 1, 2012. On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH.   \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal’s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\n DOCKET NO:  This the unique identifier assigned to the case. A docket number can contain multiple tickets. \r\nTICKET NO: This is the unique identifier of the issued ticket. A ticket can contain up to two code violations.\r\nRESPONDENT: The name of the entity issued the code violation notice.  \r\nCASE TYPE: The Case Types are historic 3-Day Notice, Air Pollution Defect Notice, Administrative Hearing, Summary Abatement, Chicago Storage Tank NOV, State Administrative Citation, State Violation Notice, historic Pre Enforcement Conference, and historic Ticket-Municipal Prosecution.\t\r\nVIOLATION DATE: The date of the code violation.  \r\nCODE VIOLATION: The municipal or state code being cited in the ticket. \r\nDISPOSITION: The outcome of the individual code violation. \r\nCASE STATUS: The final or most current status of the case.   \r\nFINE AMONT: This is the total fine assessed for the case not including court fees. Note that this value is not unique to the record but applies to the entire case. For example, the case with a Docket No of 07DE000171 has two records with a Fine Amount of $350 in each record. The total fine on the case is $350, not the sum of $700.\r\nCOMMENT: Additional information relating to the violation or case. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that collected the data.",

  "description" : "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) oversees approximately 250,000 street lights that illuminate arterial and residential streets in Chicago. CDOT performs repairs and bulb replacements in response to residents’ reports of street light outages. Whenever CDOT receives a report from 311’s Customer Service Requests (CSR) system of an “All Out” (an outage of 3 or more lights) the electrician assigned to make the repair looks at all the lights in that circuit (each circuit has 8-16 lights) to make sure that they are all working properly.  This metric tracks the average number of days CDOT takes to complete street lights “All Out” requests.   Total number of requests fulfilled per week is also available by mousing over columns.  The target response time for street light “All Out” repairs is within 4 days.  To report a street light outage, call 311 or see http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/traffic_signals_andstreetlights/svcs/request_street_lights.html",

  "description" : "The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940.  During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey:\r\n\r\n1.\tA color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance.  This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: \"Red\" and \"Orange.\"  Buildings and structures coded \"Red\" or \"Orange\" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago’s Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003.\r\n\r\n2.\tOnly buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented.  Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded.  If an “Orange”- or “Red”-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map.  The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as “Orange” or “Red;” however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as “Orange” or “Red.”\r\n\r\nAdditional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.\r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, is required.

In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the “Street Number From” column) is used.

Addresses that fail to geocode are assigned the coordinates 41.88415000022252°, -87.63241000012124°.This coordinate is located approximately just south of the intersection of W Randolph and N LaSalle.\r\nCOMPLAINTS:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Complaints dataset. \r\nNESHAPS & DEMOLITON NOTICES:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Asbestos and Demolition Notification dataset. \r\nENFORCEMENT:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Enforcement dataset. \r\nINSPECTIONS:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Inspections dataset. \r\nPERMITS:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Permits dataset. \r\nTANKS:  A ‘Y’ indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Storage Tanks dataset.",

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago.  This dataset is in KML format. To view or use these files, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.\r\n\r\nThis information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite.  The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery.  Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required.  These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage).\r\n\r\nThe results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs.  A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago.  The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet.  The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1).  The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "description" : "This map and corresponding dataset provide the location, satellite images and square footage of existing green roofs within the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThis dataset is in ESRI shapefile format. To view or use these files, compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS, is required. This information is derived from an analysis of high-spatial resolution (50cm), pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, 8-band multi-spectral satellite images collected by Digital Globe’s Worldview-2 satellite. The City supplied the consultant with a 2009 City boundary shapefile to determine the required extent of the imagery. Acquisition of three different strips of imagery corresponding to the satellite’s paths was required. These strips of imagery spanned three consecutive months and were collected in August 2010 (90% coverage), September 2010 (5% coverage) and October 2010 (5% coverage). The results of the analysis include overall count of vegetated roofs, their total square footage, and the ratio of required to elective vegetated roofs. A total of 359 vegetated roofs were identified within the City of Chicago. The total square footage of these vegetated roofs was calculated to be approximately 5,469,463 square feet. The ratio of required vegetated roofs to elective vegetative roofs was 297:62 (~5:1). The median size of the vegetated roofs was calculated to be 5,234 square feet.",

  "createdAt" : 1363976325,
  "description" : "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for  1270 traffic segments. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/Vz3rIh.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street, sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners, transportation engineers, real-estate developers, marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.\r\nData Owner: Transportation.\r\nTime Period: 2006.\r\nFrequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.\r\nRelated Applications: Traffic Information Interactive Map (http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/traffic/).",

  "description" : "The Chicago Historic Resources Survey (CHRS), completed in 1995, was a decade-long research effort by the City of Chicago to analyze the historic and architectural importance of all buildings, objects, structures, and sites constructed in the city prior to 1940. During 12 years of field work and follow-up research that started in 1983, CHRS surveyors identified approximately 9,900 properties which were considered to have some historic or architectural importance. \nPlease note that this CHRS dataset is limited and does not include the entire survey: \n\n1.\tA color-coded ranking system was used to identify historic and architectural significance relative to age, degree of external physical integrity, and level of possible significance. This dataset only includes buildings identified with the two highest color codes: \"Red\" and \"Orange.\" Buildings and structures coded \"Red\" or \"Orange\" (unless designated as a Chicago Landmark or located within a Chicago Landmark District) are subject to the City of Chicago’s Demolition-Delay Ordinance (link to: http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/demolition_delay.html), adopted by City Council in 2003. \n\n2.\tOnly buildings are included in this dataset; structures and objects such as bridges, park structures, monuments and mausoleums, generally are not represented. Likewise, garages, coach houses, and other secondary structures associated with a building may not be consistently depicted or color-coded. If an “Orange”- or “Red”-rated building was demolished after 2008, it may still appear in the map. The CHRS occasionally rated only part of a building or part of a group of joined buildings as “Orange” or “Red;” however the entire building or group of joined buildings may be incorrectly identified as “Orange” or “Red.” \n\nAdditional information about the CHRS is available at www.cityofchicago.org/Landmarks/ or by contacting the Historic Preservation Division at (312) 744-3200.\n\nTo view or use this KMZ file, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as Google Earth, are required.

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "No new tavern licenses can be issued to any location that is within 400 feet of existing businesses already licensed for the sale of alcoholic liquor in certain zoning districts. Measurements are made from the property line and exclude streets, alleys, and public ways. This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs.\r\n\r\nThere are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: •\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. •\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. •\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use these shapefiles, compression software, such as 7-Zip, and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS or QGIS, are required.

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nUnallocated Funds: Available funds at the beginning of the current year. This includes incremental property tax revenue from prior years. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nUnallocated Bond/Note Proceeds: Available funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender. \r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years.

The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

  "description" : "No new tavern licenses can be issued to any location that is within 400 feet of existing businesses already licensed for the sale of alcoholic liquor in certain zoning districts. Measurements are made from the property line and exclude streets, alleys, and public ways. This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs. There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises. These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages. They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council. It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted. Columns are as follows: •\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County. If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore. They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. •\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to. •\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council. Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed. \r\n\r\nTo view or use this KML file, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.

  "description" : "There are nine major classes of liquor licenses in the City of Chicago, the most common being Tavern, Package Goods and Incidental - Consumption on Premises.  These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages.  They are described at the following link: http://bit.ly/P0Gn4c. \r\n \r\nThe Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code.  In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium.   However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward.   Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions.\r\n \r\nThese GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council.  It is updated monthly if any restrictions have been added or deleted.  Columns are as follows:\r\n•\tCODE refers to the specific ordinance passed by City County.  If there are more than one, they are connected by an underscore.  They are in the format ww.nnn where ww is the ward number and nnn is a sequential number. \r\n•\tST_SDE refers to which side of the street the ordinance refers to.  \r\n•\tCREADATE is the date that the ordinance was input into the digital system, usually within a week after passed by City Council.   Dates before 2003 do not relect the actual date passed.\r\n\r\nTo view or use this KML file, special GIS software such as Google Earth is required.

  "description" : "This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/103beCf.",

  "description" : "This API is based on the Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Segment (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/77hq-huss) dataset.\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.",

  "description" : "This API is based on the Chicago Traffic Tracker - Historical Congestion Estimates by Region (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/emtn-qqdi) dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions. Current estimates of traffic congestion by region are available at http://bit.ly/103beCf.",

  "description" : "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org.

It reflects the City’s operating budget at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2014.This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget as of January 1. It is extracted from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are displayed; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data are updated annually.

  "description" : "Special Service Areas (SSA) boundaries in Chicago. The Special Service Area program is a mechanism used to fund expanded services and programs through a localized property tax levy within contiguous industrial, commercial and residential areas. The enhanced services and programs are in addition to services and programs currently provided through the city. SSA-funded projects could include, but are not limited to, security services, area marketing and advertising assistance, promotional activities such as parades and festivals, or any variety of small scale capital improvements that could be supported through a modest property tax levy. The data can be viewed on the Chicago Data Portal with a web browser. However, to view or use the files outside of a web browser, you will need to use compression software and special GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS (shapefile) or Google Earth (KML or KMZ).",
