  "description" : "NLRB C-Case (Unfair Labor Practice) data from CATS (Case Activity Tracking System) for the period of 01/01/1999 through 09/30/2011.Please be aware that from April 2011 through September 9, 2011, the NLRB implemented a new case management system (NxGen) that replaced CATS.  This was an ongoing process, and each month, from April through September, additional regions migrated to NxGen, with the data for those regions being retained solely in NxGen.  Accordingly, for cases that did not close before a region migrated to NxGen, any information regarding subsequent actions or dispositions that occurred after the region migrated to NxGen was not captured in CATS.  Thus, this is the most complete information available from CATS. This supersedes any previous XML data publication by the NLRB on Data.Gov, as significant data review and cleanup was performed in CATS prior to the migration to NxGen.  This also represents the final posting of the bulk-data (aka \"Data Dump\") from CATS.There are some known closing-date errors in this data, reflecting data-entry mistakes within CATS that have been identified and corrected within NxGen.  This data has not been corrected within CATS since CATS is no longer the system of record for this Agency.  Therefore, if any case shows a closing date beyond 09/30/2011, you can find the corrected closing date on http://www.nlrb.gov, under \"Cases & Decisions,\" \"Case Search.\"",

  "description" : "Patent Grant Bibliographic Text (2001 to Present): Contains the bibliographic text (i.e., front page) of each patent grant issued weekly (Tuesdays) from January 2001 to Present (excludes images/drawings). The file formats are Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in accordance with the U.S. Patent Grant Version 2.4 Document Type Definition (DTD) and eXtensible Markup Language (XML) in accordance with the U.S. Patent Grant Version 2.5; 4.0 International Common Element (ICE); 4.1 ICE; 4.2 ICE; 4.3 ICE; and 4.4 ICE Document Type Definitions (DTDs). Because of the concatenation of the individual SGML/XML documents, these files will not parse successfully or open/display by default in Internet Explorer. They also will not import into MS Excel. Each SGML/XML document within the file should have one start tag and one end tag. Concatenation creates a file that contains 4,000 plus start/end tag combinations. If you take one document out of the Patent Grant Bibliographic Text file and place it in a directory with the correct DTD and then double click that individual document, Internet Explorer will parse/open the document successfully. NOTE:  You may receive a warning about Active X controls. NOTE:  All Patent Grant Bibliographic Text files will open successfully in MS Word; NotePad; WordPad; and TextPad. This product includes a pgbyyyymmdd_wknn.zip or ipgbyyyymmdd_wknn.zip file for each week [where \"yyyymmdd\" is a Tuesday issue date and \"nn\" is a two-digit, fixed-length number (with leading zero) representing the sequentially-numbered week of the year]. Within each weekly zip file are three (3) files: pgbyyyymmdd.xml or ipgbyyyymmdd.xml (Bibliographic information in XML ICE); pgbyyyymmddlst.txt or ipgbyyyymmddlst.txt (List of patent grant numbers in ascending order); pgbyyyymmddrpt.txt or ipgbyyyymmddrpt.html (Statistical/summary report).

  "description" : "CoastWatch is a nationwide National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) program within which the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) functions as the Great Lakes regional node. In this capacity, GLERL obtains, produces, and delivers environmental data and products for near real-time observation of the Great Lakes to support environmental science, decision making, and supporting research. This is achieved by providing access to near real-time and retrospective satellite observations and in-situ Great Lakes data. The goals and objectives of the CoastWatch Great Lakes Program directly support NOAA's statutory responsibilities in estuarine and marine science living marine resource protection, and ecosystem monitoring and management.The CoastWatch node at GLERL provides clients including Federal, state, and local agencies, academic institutions, commercial/industries and the public, both within and outside of the Great Lakes region, with access to near real-time satellite observations and in-situ data for the Great Lakes. CoastWatch data are used in a variety of ways, including near real-time observation and tracking of algal blooms, plumes, ice cover, wind, water intake temperatures at fish hatcheries, two and three dimensional modeling of Great Lakes physical parameters such as wave height and currents damage assessment modeling, research, and educational and recreational activities. In addition, through a cooperative project with Michigan Sea Grant, Great Lakes CoastWatch satellite-derived surface temperature imagery is contoured and made available via Michigan State Sea Grant's web site. Great Lakes CoastWatch data and products benefit riparians as well as commercial and recreational users.GLERL is currently receiving a product suite of 33 enhanced digital images including satellite-derived surface temperature (Fig. 1.1), visible and near-infrared reflectance, brightness temperatures, cloud masks, and satellite/solar zenith angle data from the NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of satellites as well as GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) visible, near infrared, and water vapor data. These products are acquired by GLERL from NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) on a daily schedule via Internet. In addition, MODIS true color 250m resolution imagery (Fig. 1.2) of each Great Lake (received near real-time from the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin), in-situ and modeled data, including marine and meteorological observations, buoy observations, water level gauge measurements from NOAA's National Ocean Service, and Great Lakes Surface Environmental Analysis (GLSEA) composite charts (Fig. 1.3), are routinely acquired or produced, stored, and made available to Great Lakes CoastWatch data users. Great Lakes Forecasting system (nowcast and forecast) products are also available to CoastWatch data users. Near real-time AVHRR satellite data for the past 2 weeks are available at GLERL, and access to a retrospective archive that begins in 1990 is available via an Internet link to the NOAA CoastWatch Active Access System at the NESDIS Satellite Active Archive.",

  "description" : "Contains the bibliographic text (i.e., front page) of each patent application publication (non-provisional utility and plant) published weekly (Thursdays) from March 15, 2001 to Present (excludes images/drawings). The file formats are eXtensible Markup Language (XML) in accordance with the U.S. Patent Application Version 1.5; 1.6; 4.0 International Common Element (ICE); 4.1 ICE; 4.2 ICE; and 4.3 ICE Document Type Definitions (DTDs). Because of the concatenation of the individual XML documents, these files will not parse successfully or open/display by default in Internet Explorer. They also will not import into MS Excel. Each XML document within the file should have one start tag and one end tag. Concatenation creates a file that contains 5,000 plus start/end tag combinations. If you take one document out of the Patent Application Publication Bibliographic file and place it in a directory with the correct DTD and then double click that individual document, Internet Explorer will parse/open the document successfully. NOTE:  You may receive a warning about Active X controls. NOTE:  All Patent Application Publication Bibliographic files will open successfully in MS Word; NotePad; WordPad; and TextPad. This product includes a pabyyyymmdd_wknn.zip or ipabyyyymmdd_wknn.zip file for each week [where \"yyyymmdd\" is a Thursday publication date and \"nn\" is a two-digit, fixed-length number (with leading zero) representing the sequentially-numbered week of the year]. Within each weekly zip file are (3) files:  pabyyyymmdd.xml or ipabyyyymmdd.xml (Bibliographic information in XML ICE); pabyyyymmddlst.txt or ipabyyyymmddlst.txt (List of published patent application numbers in ascending order); and pabyyyymmddrpt.txt or ipabyyyymmddrpt.html (Statistical/summary report). Approx. 5,000 patent application publications per week. Approx. 2.7 MB per weekly zipfile.",

All programs are closed to new issues except for Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance and Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance.  United States Government Life Insurance was issued to WWI military personnel and Veterans.  National Service Life Insurance was established to meet the needs of WWII military personnel and Veterans.  Veterans' Special Life Insurance was issued to Korean War-era Veterans.  Veterans' Reopened Insurance provides coverage to certain classes of disabled Veterans from WWII and the Korean conflict who had dropped their government life insurance coverage.  Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance was established in 1951 and is available to Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance was established in 1971 to provide mortgage protection life insurance to severely disabled Veterans who have received grants for the purchase of specially adapted housing.",

Because of the concatenation of the individual XML documents, these files will not parse successfully or open/display by default in Internet Explorer. They also will not import into MS Excel. Each XML document within the file should have one start tag and one end tag. Concatenation creates a file that contains 5,000 plus start/end tag combinations. If you take one document out of the Patent Application Publication Full Text file and place it in a directory with the correct DTD and then double click that individual document, Internet Explorer will parse/open the document successfully. NOTE:  You may receive a warning about Active X controls. NOTE:  All Patent Application Publication Full Text files will open successfully in MS Word; NotePad; WordPad; and TextPad.

We use this information to measure the success of waste reduction and recycling programs across the country. Our trash, or municipal solid waste (MSW), is made up of the things we commonly use and then throw away. These materials include items such as packaging, food scraps, grass clippings, sofas, computers, tires, and refrigerators. MSW does not include industrial, hazard'­ous, or construction waste. The data on Materials Discarded in the Municipal Waste Stream, 1960 to 2009, provides estimated data in thousands of tons discarded after recycling and compost recovery for the years 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009. In this data set, discards include combustion with energy recovery. This data table does not include construction & demolition debris, industrial process wastes, or certain other wastes. The \"Other\" category includes electrolytes in batteries and fluff pulp, feces, and urine in disposable diapers. Details may not add to totals due to rounding.",

  "description" : "Thank you for your interest in the Ready to Learn Television program! Ready to Learn Television supports the development of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary school children and their families. Its general goal is to promote early learning and school readiness, with a particular interest in reaching low-income children. In addition to creating television and other media products, the program supports activities intended to promote national distribution of the programming, effective educational uses of the programming, community-based outreach, and research on educational effectiveness. You can use the tools below to look at general information about the grant applications that were submitted in June 2010. There were a total of 38 eligible applications, of which three were selected for funding. In this 2010 competition, applicants were invited to submit proposals for the development of innovative transmedia programming - that is, the use of television and other media such as the internet, mobile devices, and print in interconnected ways. In the 2010 grant competition, there was a two-tier review process in which the applications that scored the highest against the program's general review criteria were advanced to a second tier in which their responses to the competitive preference priority on research were scored. In the data summaries below, applicants that advanced to tier two are denoted as \"highly rated applicants,\" and those that received awards are listed as \"grantees\". The data presented here is sourced from the applications submitted to the program. The data may not be a full representation of the information provided in the formal application. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate or guarantee the accuracy of this information.

  "description" : "The U. S. Geological Survey Central Energy Resources Science Center's Organic Geochemistry Laboratory is a research laboratory devoted to the investigation of the origin and occurrence of organic fossil fuels. Although it is not a service laboratory, many of the analytical results from the laboratory could prove useful in future petroleum geological and geochemical studies. In order to archive these results, the USGS developed an Alaskan Organic Geochemical Data Base (AOGDB) in 1978 to house the data from not only the USGS's involvement in the project, but also the data accumulated from a variety of sub-contracting laboratories. The accumulated data resided in a flat text file entitled \"PGS\" and was maintained by Petroleum Information Corporation. The information provided here is a distillation of ASCII tables that originated in the master flat files of the relational AOGDB files.",

  "description" : "The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) surveyed Fresno Reservoir in June of 2010 to develop a topographic map and compute a storage-elevation relationship (area-capacity tables).  The bathymetric survey was conducted using sonic depth recording equipment interfaced with RTK GPS that measured the sounding locations within the reservoir. The survey system software continuously recorded reservoir depths and horizontal coordinates as the survey boat moved along grid lines established to cover the reservoir.  The survey vessel's guidance system provided directions to the boat operator to assist in maintaining a course along these predetermined lines.  As each line was traversed, the depth and position data were recorded on a computer hard drive for subsequent processing.  The water surface elevations at the dam, Reclamation gage records and RTK GPS measurements were used to convert the sonic depth measurements to lake-bottom elevations.",

Please note that the Preliminary Toxics Release Inventory dataset is not yet complete and will be updated every two weeks as the TRI Program continues to process additional reporting year 2012 TRI submissions. DISCLAIMER: See http://www2.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program/2012-tri-preliminary-dataset for limitations and other information regarding the use of this data.",

These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.",
